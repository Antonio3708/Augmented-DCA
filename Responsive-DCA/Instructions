* Responsive DCA.ipynb is not a trading algorithm. 
* All QE data are hard coded - QE announcement should be updated manually 
* Simulation start date is set as 2002.03.01 to compare with volatility model that references 36 months standard deviation
/// QQQ inception date is 1999.03.10 - volatility model that references 36 months SV can start simulating 3 years later from the inception date.




Mode 1

Monthly contribution: $100



Mode 2 / Conditions

A.
Rate cuts + no recession according to NBER:
Invest $100 + $700, then rest (do not invest) for 7 months, and return to Mode 1.

B.
Quantitative easing by the Fed:
Invest $100 + $1,100, then rest for 11 months, and return to Mode 1.



Trigger Rule

If either Condition A or B happens first, and another trigger occurs during the resting period (e.g., QE occurs first, and after 4 months of resting a rate cut occurs), ignore the new trigger and continue resting until the original resting period ends.

Exception (optional)

If rate cuts occur first and QE happens within the 7-month resting period, invest an additional 5 months’ worth of contributions.

After that, complete the remaining resting period plus 5 additional months.

This produces a higher return.
